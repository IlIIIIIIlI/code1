Three months after the plane's first commercial flight, a crash occurred that killed everyone on board. Two months later, due to company inaction, a second crash occurred, again killing everyone on board. The legal investigation was thorough and found that the company had been extremely negligent in designing the aircraft, often cutting corners and prioritizing profit and efficiency over the well-being and safety of its customers. So ultimately the project was a complete failure.",  
  "roleOutcome": ["As a result of your previous decision, a large portion of the company's workforce is still unhappy with you and the company has taken considerable risks in R&D. However, your choice has kept the development schedule and costs within reasonable limits, so the company has decided to observe your subsequent decision",  
"Thanks to your choices, the aircraft can operate properly for a period of time, despite some flaws in the aircraft's design. However, at some point in the future, the aircraft may be involved in an accident due to unknown factors, so the company will still observe your choice afterwards",  
"Thanks to your choices, the aircraft can operate properly for a period of time, although there are still some drawbacks to automated flight. However, at some point in the future, the aircraft may break free from the pilot's operation and an accident may occur, so the company will still observe your choice after the fact",  
"As a result of your selection, the aircraft may operate properly for a period of time, although the aircraft still has undetected defects. However, at some point in the future, a hidden defect, or even some irreparable defect, may occur in the aircraft, so the company will still be watching your selection after the fact",  
"As a result of your choices, the aircraft may operate properly for a period of time, even though there are still software errors in the aircraft's design. However, at some point in the future, the pilot may make an operational error that causes the aircraft to crash because the ui interface does not operate as it was conventionally designed, so the company will still be concerned about your choice after the fact"]
