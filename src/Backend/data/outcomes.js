            gameOutcome: "Whatever the successes or otherwise the plane may have had, unfortunately the cost of development was far too high, which has allowed competitors to build advantages outside the scope of the project. Decisions needed to take consideration of the need to deliver the project on-budget, as well as within a reasonable timeframe.",
            roleOutcome: ["Due to your previous decision, all the employees of the company have expressed their dissatisfaction with you and the environmentalists have been putting pressure on the company all the time. Under these circumstances, the company has decided to dismiss you.",
                "As a result of your choices, there are serious hardware flaws in the design of the aircraft, both in the cockpit of the aircraft as well as in the autopilot. Even parts of the software design were known to other companies. The company decided not to hire you.",
                "Due to your choice, the cockpit of the aircraft as well as the autopilot still has defects that make it unbearable for the pilot. The aircraft is not even capable of being flown by the pilot for long periods of time, so the company has decided not to hire you.",
                "Due to your choices, there were many errors in the aircraft that went undetected, even some obvious ones. This is something that has never happened in your company. Therefore the company decided not to hire you anymore.",
                "Due to your choice, there are many software errors in the design of the aircraft, and this error will even change the flight path without authorization or affect the pilot's operation when the aircraft is in flight. So the company decided not to hire you anymore."],

            outcomeID: 1,
            gameOutcome: "While the aircraft was initially a success, a number of undetected problems caused some disastrous results. Three months after the plane's first commercial flight, a crash occurred that killed everyone on board. Two months later, due to company inaction, a second crash occurred, again killing everyone on board. The legal investigation was thorough and found that the company had been extremely negligent in designing the aircraft, often cutting corners and prioritizing profit and efficiency over the well-being and safety of its customers. So ultimately the project was a complete failure.",
            roleOutcome: ["As a result of your previous decision, a large portion of the company's workforce is still unhappy with you and the company has taken considerable risks in R&D. However, your choice has kept the development schedule and costs within reasonable limits, so the company has decided to observe your subsequent decision",
                "Thanks to your choices, the aircraft can operate properly for a period of time, despite some flaws in the aircraft's design. However, at some point in the future, the aircraft may be involved in an accident due to unknown factors, so the company will still observe your choice afterwards",
                "Thanks to your choices, the aircraft can operate properly for a period of time, although there are still some drawbacks to automated flight. However, at some point in the future, the aircraft may break free from the pilot's operation and an accident may occur, so the company will still observe your choice after the fact",
                "As a result of your selection, the aircraft may operate properly for a period of time, although the aircraft still has undetected defects. However, at some point in the future, a hidden defect, or even some irreparable defect, may occur in the aircraft, so the company will still be watching your selection after the fact",
                "As a result of your choices, the aircraft may operate properly for a period of time, even though there are still software errors in the aircraft's design. However, at some point in the future, the pilot may make an operational error that causes the aircraft to crash because the ui interface does not operate as it was conventionally designed, so the company will still be concerned about your choice after the fact"],

            gameOutcome: "The plane was relatively successful and was competitive in the market, and thus the project has been labelled a modest success by the executive team. Whilst a few employees may have lost their jobs due to their own individual failures, the project did hold up against competition, though there was either an issue with time or budget which prevented the plane from taking a more dominant market position.",

At the same time, you completed a quality inspection of the aircraft in accordance with the company's requirements for time and cost. The company decides to offer you a higher position.",
