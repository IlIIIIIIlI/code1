# GE-RedBack 🎮

Game of Ethics is an interactive game aimed at investigating how decisions made in the process of designing a plane affect the final outcome. Five players take on different roles: Executive, Developer, Pilot, Engineer, and FAA. The game consists of two phases: answering personal questions separately, followed by a group discussion. The final outcome is determined based on the choices made by the players.
